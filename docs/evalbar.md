1. CSS Transition (Basic Smoothing)

Instead of instantly setting the bar’s height/fill percentage, apply a transition so it animates to the new value:

.eval-bar {
  transition: height 0.4s ease-in-out;
}


When you update the height (or top/bottom) in JS, it will slide smoothly instead of jumping.

2. Interpolated Animation (JS-driven)

If you want more control:

Capture the old percentage (fromPercent) and new percentage (toPercent).

Use requestAnimationFrame to interpolate between them over a set duration.

Update DOM style each frame.

function animateEvalBar(element, from, to, duration = 400) {
  const start = performance.now();

  function step(timestamp) {
    const progress = Math.min((timestamp - start) / duration, 1);
    const eased = progress * (2 - progress); // ease-out
    const current = from + (to - from) * eased;

    element.style.height = `${current}%`;

    if (progress < 1) requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(step);
}

3. Physics-based (Spring / Inertia Feeling)

For extra polish, use a spring simulation (like Framer Motion’s spring
 or a custom Hook in React).
That way, instead of a rigid linear slide, the bar “bounces” slightly, feeling alive.

4. Micro-frame Interpolation (Predictive Smoothing)

If you want to simulate a more continuous shift rather than just animating between discrete moves:

Store the evaluation of the next move in advance.

Begin moving toward it slightly before the player steps.

This creates a predictive feel (like the bar is "alive" with the review).

🔑 The main trade-off:

Simple transition = very easy to implement.

Interpolation / springs = smoother and more natural but requires more code.

Do you want me to sketch out a React/Tailwind example of a smooth eval bar (like Chess.com’s but animated), so you can see how it’d look in practice?
